    <p>This would make a fab date night meal. In fact, it's perfect with Valentine's Day coming up tomorrow if you're looking<br> for an idea. Make it even if you're single. Why the heck not?
     Serve it over pasta or with mashed or roasted potatoes. <br>For a vegetable I'd steam some  broccolini, carrots, or even serve sweet corn with it. Or make a light salad to offset <br> that cream.

    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Cut your chicken breasts in half lengthwise to make 4 thinner cutlets.<br> Sprinkle them with salt and pepper and garlic powder, then dredge them in <br> flour so they're nicely coated.</li>
      <li>Add the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter to a skillet over medium-high <br>heat. Once the pan is hot, add the chicken and cook for 4-5 minutes/side <br> until golden. Take the chicken out of the pan and set aside (chicken<br> shouldn't be fully cooked yet).</li>
      <li>Add the wine and chicken broth to the pan and let it bubble for about a<br> minute. Stir to scrape up any bits from the bottom of the pan.</li>
      <li>Add the remaining butter and the Herbs de Provence to the pan, and <br>continue simmering for another 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add the cream and chicken back into the pan. Reduce the heat to medium <br>and cook for another 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and<br> the sauce has thickened up a bit. Season with extra salt & pepper if needed.</li>
    </ol>
